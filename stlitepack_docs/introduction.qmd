# stlitepack

`stlitepack` is a lightweight Python package that helps you transform existing [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) apps into [stlite](https://github.com/whitphx/stlite) apps â€” fully client-side, serverless apps that can be deployed as static files (e.g., via GitHub Pages).

With `stlitepack`, you can package a Streamlit app into a single `index.html` file that runs entirely in the browser.

---

## âœ¨ Why stlitepack?

Streamlit is a fantastic framework for rapid prototyping and data apps.
But deploying small, simple apps often requires a server, which adds complexity.

**stlite** solves this by compiling Streamlit to WebAssembly and running it directly in the browser.
`stlitepack` makes the transition easy: it takes your existing `app.py` and turns it into a stlite-ready bundle.

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… **Single-page app packaging** into `index.html`
- âœ… Support for requirements via `requirements.txt` or inline list
- âœ… Function-call based API (`pack()`)

Planned:
- ðŸ”œ Multi-page app support
- ðŸ”œ Resource bundling (images, datasets, assets)
- ðŸ”œ GitHub Pages auto-deploy (via GitHub Actions)
